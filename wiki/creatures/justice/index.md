# Prudence #

Prudence manifests itself through [Numenite][/creatures/numenite] into
creatures of a reflective nature. They are apt to be lounging, to be
introspective and inquisitive, and to react to situations after
forethought. When they are Good, they are respectful, thoughtful, and
empathetic. When they are Bad, they are two-faced, judgemental, and
elitest.
