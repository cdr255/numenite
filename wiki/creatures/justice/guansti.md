__Guansti__ is the third Numenite creature we recorded. One of our
researchers maintains a __Guansti__ as her partner nearly constantly,
though we have examined the __Guansti__ of various citizens of the
city of [Joren](/world/cities/joren.html).

__Guansti__ is considered by the
[NCRA](/world/culture/numenite-creature-restriction-association.html)
to be a _Level 1_ dangerous Numen, fit for many people to own.

## Biology ## {style=""}


__Guansti__ is a marsupial, quadrupedal creature with colorful,
patterned fur. It has prominent, pointed ears and dark, round
eyes. Its muzzle is squared off, with a dark nose and lighter fur. It
has large, muscular rear legs which it uses to leap 3-5x its height in
a single bound, and large, padded feet which it uses to do so. Its
fore legs are *much* smaller, and have pads for gripping onto rocks on
the palms. It often has these fore feet in the air, or holding
something. They also have a long, musclar tail which they use to
maintain their balance, and a pouch which they might store things in
on their belly. It likes to leap around rocky terrain, and will climb
higher and look around whenever possible.
