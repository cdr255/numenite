# Justice #

Justice manifests itself through [Numenite](/creatures/numenite) into
creatures of a fair nature. They are apt to be sitting, to be voluble
and honest, and to act in the way they deem most fair. When they are
Good, they are honorable, equitable, and open-minded. When they are
Bad, they are calculating, argumentative, and dubious.
