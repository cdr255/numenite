__Guandent__ is the second Numenite creature we recorded.

Our research was based on the study of a random sampling of
aristocrats with __Guandent__, over the course of many weeks. Because
of this, we feel our findings our representative of the general
creature.

__Guandent__ is considered by the
[NCRA](/world/culture/numenite-creature-restriction-association.html)
to be a _Level 1_ dangerous Numen, fit for many people to own.

## Biology ## {style=""}

__Guandent__ is a rodent-like, quadrupedal creature with a barrel
shaped body and reddish-brown fur. Underneath, its fur turns
yellowish-brown. Its fur is coarse and long haired. Its ears are
small, dark, and round, perched above its dark, oval shaped eyes,
which are near the top of their heads. Their muzzles are blunt, with
nostrils and forenose being hairless. It has three toes on its rear
feet, and four on its fore feet. Its hind legs are slightly longer
than its fore legs. It has four long teeth (two on top, two in bottom)
visible when it opens its mouth. This creature likes the water, and
loamy soil. It rests on the ground with its limbs tucked away beneath
it.
