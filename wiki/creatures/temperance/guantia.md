__Guantia__ is the first Numenite creature we recorded. Our research
was based on the study of a few notable people's __Guantia__, most
notably [Prince Eamon's](/world/historical/prince-eamon.html)
"Advisor." However, at both
[Eamon's](/world/historical/prince-eamon.html) and Advisor's requests,
we have _not_ used Advisor's likeness as the picture.

__Guantia__ is considered by the
[NCRA](/world/culture/numenite-creature-restriction-association.html)
to be a _Level 1_ dangerous Numen, fit for many people to own.
