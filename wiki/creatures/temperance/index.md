# Temperance #

Temperence manifests itself through [Numenite](/creatures/numenite)
into creatures with reserved personalities. They are most apt to be
standing still, to be regimented and orderly, and to refrain from
acting. When they are Good, they are pillars of strength, beacons of
order, and clearheaded. When they are Bad, they are dismissive,
pedantic, and beaurecratic.
